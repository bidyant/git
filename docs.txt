git config --global core.editor vim

===================================================================================
git init               => starting a new project

git add --a            => all files included (git add .)
git add fileName       => single file

git status             => to check anything to commit

git restore fileName       => to restore change from file to prev. commit //use carefully
git restore --staged <file> => unstage file

git commit -m "cmt"    => to commit in master branch 
git commit -a -m "cmt" => only tagged file, newly untracked file will not be comitted.

git commit --amend     => to change comment of commit

git log                => to check status of commit
git log -p             => to check added removed in commit

//we can also get commit according to date and time using different command.

git checkout --fileName => to recover mistake & got to prev. version
git checkout -f         => to recover all files of previous commit
//if you want that some file will not go to prev commit, then add them in .gitignore and do above
git checkout <commit-hash> => to go to next commit 

git diff               => to diff between staged and newly edited version
